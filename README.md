# Dino Runner Game - Java Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Dino Runner Game project! This is a simple and fun Java-based game inspired by the classic T-Rex Runner game from Google Chrome's offline mode. In this game, players control a cute dinosaur and help it navigate through a desert landscape filled with obstacles.

## How to Play

To play the game, follow these simple instructions:

1. **Launch the Game:** Compile and run the `UserInterface.java` file to start the game. (In order to run this, compile all the \*.java files and start from class UserInterface.)

2. **Control the Dinosaur:** Use the following keyboard keys to control the dinosaur:
   - **Spacebar:** Jump over obstacles.
   - **Down Arrow:** Duck under obstacles.

3. **Avoid Obstacles:** Navigate the dinosaur through the desert, jumping over cacti, and ducking under pterodactyls to avoid collisions.

4. **Score Points:** Your score increases as you successfully navigate through obstacles. Try to achieve the highest score possible!

5. **Game Over:** The game ends when the dinosaur collides with an obstacle. You can restart the game by pressing the spacebar.
